=====================================

The Network Policy View allows CRUD of Network Policy View resource on Volterra SaaS

~> **Note:** Please refer to [Network Policy View API docs](https://volterra.io/docs/api/views-network-policy-view) to learn more

Example Usage
-------------

```hcl
resource "volterra_network_policy_view" "example" {
  name      = "acmecorp-web"
  namespace = "staging"

  endpoint {
    // One of the arguments from this list "prefix_list any outside_endpoints inside_endpoints interface namespace label_selector" must be set

    prefix_list {
      prefixes = ["192.168.20.0/24"]
    }
  }
}

```
