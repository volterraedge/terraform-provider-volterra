Resource volterra_api_credential
================================

================================

Credentials created via volterra_api_credential inherits same user that of the creator and it gets same RBAC applied to the user. So when this credential is used in APIs, it will have same response/audit as creator of the credential is.

For each these credentials, user can request credential in 3 different formats as required by their usecase:

API certificate - a password protected P12 certificate bundle virtual k8s kubeconfig - a kubeconfig to access a cluster with embedded user access with client certificate. API token - an easy to use secret that can be send part of HTTP request header Authorization: APIToken
